- **HTML5**  
- **CSS3** (Responsive layout using `clamp()` and media queries)  
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**  

---

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

This project helped me learn and practice:

- JavaScript game loops using `setInterval`
- State management using a centralized `gameState` object
- DOM manipulation and event handling
- Keyboard and mobile touch input handling
- Collision detection logic
- Audio handling in browser games
- Debugging real-world logic and UI state issues
- Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Using Git with meaningful commits and refactors

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- 🎨 Snake gradient animations  
- 🧩 Additional game modes  
- ⚛️ React version of the Snake Game  

---

## 📌 Note

This project is intentionally built using **pure JavaScript** to strengthen core fundamentals before moving to frameworks like React.
